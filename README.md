An overhaul of Audacity's UI.

Despite being fully featured, Audacity's UI is notoriously clunky. Specifically it suffers unintuitive front-end design decisions and a blatantly cluttered and outdated visual aesthetic that favors skeuomorphism over contemporary, flat graphic design.  This results in navigation confusion and lowered confidence with respect to ease of use for new users, which includes novice music producers as well as those who are more experienced.
